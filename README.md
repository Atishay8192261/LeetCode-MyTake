# LeetCode-MyTake

This repository is a collection of my LeetCode solutions, where I share my problem-solving approach right after completing each challenge. My focus is on finding the most practical and efficient solutions, prioritizing convenience over sticking to specific topics or rigid techniques. Each solution is accompanied by a clear explanation of my thought process, demonstrating how I tackle problems in a way that works best in the moment, while ensuring optimal results.


## Approach

In this repository, I focus on:
- **Efficiency**: Finding the most convenient and time-effective solutions.
- **Practicality**: Prioritizing problem-solving methods that work best in the moment, even if they don't strictly adhere to traditional techniques.
- **Clarity**: Each solution includes clear explanations of my approach and thought process, making it easy to follow along.

## Repository Structure

The solutions are organized into categories based on problem types or difficulty levels. Each solution file contains:
- Problem description
- Link to the LeetCode problem
- My approach and explanation
- The solution code
